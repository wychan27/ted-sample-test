James - here are the files for the sample TED page
information.html => full HTML page
ted.css => CSS file associated with information.html

There is an /images/ folder that contains all of the thumbnails needed to complete HTML page.  You can use those 3 images or you can snip it from the screenshot that I sent to your Dad's email.

If you have questions / problems, call me.
